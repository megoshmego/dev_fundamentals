Code snippets for learning Git and GitHub:

1. Clone a repository:
```bash
git clone <clone_url>
```
- Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository's clone URL to create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

2. Check repository status and history:
```bash
git status
git log --oneline
```
- Use `git status` to see the current status of the repository, including any modifications or changes.
- Use `git log --oneline` to view a condensed history of the repository's commits.

3. Make changes and commits:
```bash
git add <file(s)>
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
- Use `git add` to stage changes made to the files for the next commit.
- Use `git commit -m "Commit message"` to create a new commit with a descriptive message.

4. Push changes to a remote repository:
```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```
- Use `git push` to send local commits to the remote repository specified by `origin` and the branch name.

5. Enable GitHub Pages for a repository:
- Go to the repository settings on GitHub.
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Select the branch to use for deployment.
- GitHub will generate a URL for your deployed website.

6. Pull changes from a remote repository:
```bash
git pull <remote> <branch>
```
- Use `git pull` to retrieve changes from a remote repository and update the local repository.

7. Create a README file on GitHub:
- Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
- Click on "Add file" and select "Create new file".
- Name the file `README.md`.
- Write the content using Markdown syntax.
- Commit the changes.

8. Create a new branch:
```bash
git branch <branch_name>
git checkout <branch_name>
```
- Use `git branch` to create a new branch in the repository.
- Use `git checkout` to switch to the newly created branch.

These code snippets cover the essential commands and steps for cloning a repository, checking status and history, making changes and commits, pushing changes to a remote repository, enabling GitHub Pages, pulling changes from a remote repository, creating a README file on GitHub, and creating a new branch.
