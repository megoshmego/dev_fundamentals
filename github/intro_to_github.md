Important terms and ideas:

1. Git and GitHub: Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a platform for hosting and sharing Git repositories.
2. Git locally: Git can be used on a computer without involving GitHub or creating a GitHub account.
3. Collaboration: GitHub enables collaboration among developers by providing tools like pull requests and a visual interface for reviewing and merging changes.
4. GitHub as a backup: Storing code on GitHub provides a backup in case of computer loss or damage.
5. Open source projects: Many large open source projects are hosted on GitHub, allowing developers to examine and contribute to the code.
6. Account creation: Signing up for a GitHub account is necessary to utilize its features and collaborate with others.

Code snippets:

1. Clone a GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Push local code to a GitHub repository:
```bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git push -u origin master
```

3. Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository:
```bash
git pull
```

These code snippets demonstrate basic operations like cloning a repository from GitHub, pushing local code to a GitHub repository, and fetching and merging changes from a remote repository.

Additional terms:

1. Pull request: A way to propose changes to a project by submitting a request for others to review and merge the changes.
2. Branch: A parallel version of the code that allows for separate development and experimentation.
3. Fork: Creating a personal copy of a repository on GitHub to freely make changes without affecting the original repository.
4. Repository URL: The web address that points to a specific repository on GitHub.
5. Commit history: A log of all the commits made in a Git repository, showing the changes and their authors.

Code snippets for additional terms:

1. Create a new branch:
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
git checkout <branch-name>
```

2. Fork a GitHub repository:
```bash
# Click the "Fork" button on GitHub to create a personal copy
```

3. Create a pull request:
```bash
# Make changes, commit them, and push to your repository
# Go to the original repository on GitHub and click "New pull request"
# Follow the steps to submit the pull request
```

These code snippets demonstrate concepts like creating a new branch, forking a repository, and creating a pull request on GitHub.
