Important terms and ideas:

1. GitHub: A web-based platform for version control and collaboration that allows users to host, manage, and share their Git repositories.
2. Remote repository: A repository hosted on a remote server, such as GitHub, where code can be pushed to and pulled from.
3. Repository: A storage location where a project's files and version history are stored.
4. git remote add: A command used to add a remote repository to a local Git repository.
5. Origin: The default name given to the remote repository when adding it to the local repository using git remote add.
6. git push: A command used to push local code changes to a remote repository.
7. Branch: A parallel version of a repository that allows for separate development and experimentation without affecting the main codebase.
8. git branch: A command used to create, list, or switch between branches in a Git repository.
9. git checkout: A command used to switch between different branches in a Git repository.
10. git status: A command used to view the current status of the local Git repository, including the branch, modified files, and untracked files.
11. Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the codebase at a specific point in time.

Code snippets:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
```bash
# Go to github.com/new or click the "New repository" button.
# Provide a name and optional description for the repository.
# Choose the repository visibility (public or private).
# Select the "Initialize this repository with a README" option if desired.
# Click "Create repository" to create the new repository.
```

2. Add a remote repository to a local Git repository:
```bash
# Copy the repository's clone URL from the GitHub repository page.
# Open the terminal and navigate to the local Git repository's directory.
# Run the command git remote add origin <repository_url> to add the remote repository, giving it the nickname "origin".
```

3. Push code to a remote repository:
```bash
# Use the command git push -u origin master to push the local code changes to the remote repository named "origin" on the "master" branch.
# Enter your GitHub username and password when prompted.
```

4. Push code to a specific branch:
```bash
# Use the command git push origin <branch_name> to push code changes to a specific branch in the remote repository, replacing <branch_name> with the actual branch name.
```

5. Switch between branches:
```bash
# Use the command git checkout <branch_name> to switch to a different branch in the local repository, replacing <branch_name> with the actual branch name.
```

6. View repository status and branch information:
```bash
# Use the command git status to see the current status of the local Git repository, including branch information and modified files.
```

These code snippets demonstrate the process of creating a new repository on GitHub, adding a remote repository to a local Git repository, pushing code to a remote repository, switching between branches, and checking the repository status.
