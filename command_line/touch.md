The transcript discusses the concept of creating files using the command line interface. It introduces the command "touch" as a way to create new files quickly and efficiently. Here's a simple demonstration of creating files using the touch command in a Unix-like environment:

To create a single file:
```
touch filename.txt
```

To create multiple files at once:
```
touch file1.txt file2.css file3.js
```

These commands will create the specified files in the current directory.

The touch command is named so because it is primarily used to update the access and modification times of files. However, if the file doesn't exist, touch creates an empty file with the specified name.

Please note that the demonstration provided assumes a Unix-like operating system. The touch command may have slightly different behavior or syntax in different environments.
