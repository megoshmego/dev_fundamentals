Certainly! Here are some scripts/snippets to demonstrate the usage of wildcards in the terminal:

1. Asterisk (*) wildcard:
   - Represents any sequence of characters.
   - Example: `ls *.txt` matches all files ending with `.txt`.

```bash
# List all files ending with .txt in the current directory
ls *.txt
```

2. Question mark (?) wildcard:
   - Represents any single character.
   - Example: `ls file?.txt` matches files like `file1.txt`, `fileA.txt`, etc.

```bash
# List files with "file" followed by any single character and .txt extension
ls file?.txt
```

3. Bracket [] wildcard:
   - Represents a range or set of characters.
   - Example: `ls file[0-9].txt` matches files like `file0.txt`, `file1.txt`, etc.

```bash
# List files with "file" followed by a digit (0-9) and .txt extension
ls file[0-9].txt
```

4. Tilde (~) expansion:
   - Represents the home directory.
   - Example: `cd ~/Documents` navigates to the "Documents" directory in the home directory.

```bash
# Change to the Documents directory in the home directory
cd ~/Documents
```

5. Dot (.) wildcard:
   - Represents the current directory.
   - Example: `ls ./subdir/*.txt` matches all `.txt` files in the "subdir" directory relative to the current directory.

```bash
# List .txt files in the "subdir" directory relative to the current directory
ls ./subdir/*.txt
```

6. Double asterisk (**) wildcard:
   - Matches directories and subdirectories recursively.
   - Example: `ls **/*.txt` matches all `.txt` files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

```bash
# List .txt files in the current directory and its subdirectories
ls **/*.txt
```

These scripts/snippets demonstrate the usage of wildcards in various scenarios. You can try them in your terminal to see the results and further explore how wildcards can help you work more efficiently with multiple files and directories.
