The transcript discusses the concept of using wildcards in the terminal for more efficient and flexible commands. Wildcards are characters that represent one or more other characters, allowing you to match multiple files or directories based on patterns.

Here are some common wildcards and their usage:

1. Asterisk (*) wildcard:
   - Represents any sequence of characters.
   - Example: `ls *.txt` matches all files ending with `.txt`.

2. Question mark (?) wildcard:
   - Represents any single character.
   - Example: `ls file?.txt` matches files like `file1.txt`, `fileA.txt`, etc.

3. Bracket [] wildcard:
   - Represents a range or set of characters.
   - Example: `ls file[0-9].txt` matches files like `file0.txt`, `file1.txt`, etc.

4. Tilde (~) expansion:
   - Represents the home directory.
   - Example: `cd ~/Documents` navigates to the "Documents" directory in the home directory.

5. Dot (.) wildcard:
   - Represents the current directory.
   - Example: `ls ./subdir/*.txt` matches all `.txt` files in the "subdir" directory relative to the current directory.

6. Double asterisk (**) wildcard:
   - Matches directories and subdirectories recursively.
   - Example: `ls **/*.txt` matches all `.txt` files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

Using wildcards allows you to perform operations on multiple files or directories that match a specific pattern, saving time and effort.

Please note that wildcard behavior may vary across different operating systems and shells.
