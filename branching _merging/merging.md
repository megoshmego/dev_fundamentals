Important terms and ideas:

1. Branch merging: Merging branches is the process of combining the changes from one branch into another branch. It is commonly used to integrate new features or changes made on separate branches back into the main branch, such as the master branch.
2. Branch workflow: It is a common practice in many development teams to work on feature branches or separate branches for code changes. The changes are reviewed, tested, and approved before merging them into the main branch.
3. git merge: The `git merge` command is used to merge branches in Git. It combines the changes from the specified branch into the current branch (the branch you are on when running the command).
4. Clean working tree: Before performing actions like merging, it is recommended to have a clean working tree, which means all changes should be committed or discarded to avoid unintended conflicts.
5. Merging branches: When merging branches, Git brings the commits from the source branch into the target branch, creating a new commit that incorporates the changes. The commit history and file changes of the merged branch are added to the target branch.
6. Deleting branches: After merging a branch, it is safe to delete the branch since all the changes from that branch have been merged into the target branch. The `git branch -d` or `git branch -D` command is used to delete branches, with the `-D` option used for force deletion.

Code snippets:

1. Checking out a branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```
- Use `git checkout` followed by the branch name to switch to the specified branch.

2. Merging branches:
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```
- Use `git merge` followed by the branch name to merge the specified branch into the current branch.

3. Deleting branches:
```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```
- Use `git branch -d` followed by the branch name to delete the specified branch. The branch should already be merged into the target branch.
```bash
git branch -D <branch_name>
```
- Use `git branch -D` followed by the branch name to force delete the specified branch, even if it has not been merged.

These code snippets demonstrate the concepts of checking out branches, merging branches, and deleting branches in Git.
