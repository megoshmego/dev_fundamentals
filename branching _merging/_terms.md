Important terms and definitions:

1. Creating a branch and switching simultaneously: The process of creating a new branch and immediately switching to it in Git using the `git checkout -b <branch_name>` command.

2. Branch: A parallel version of a repository that allows for independent development and experimentation without affecting the main codebase.

3. Default branch: The initial branch in a Git repository, commonly named "master," which is automatically created when initializing a new repository.

4. Switching branches: The action of moving between different branches in a Git repository to work on different sets of changes.

5. Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the codebase at a specific point in time, recorded in the Git repository's history.

6. Git log: A command used to display the commit history of the current branch, showing all the commits and their corresponding information.

7. Merge conflict: A situation that arises when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches due to conflicting changes made to the same file or files. Manual intervention is required to resolve the conflicts.

8. Fast-forward merge: A type of merge that occurs when the branches being merged have a linear history, and one branch is ahead of the other. Git can automatically apply the commits from the source branch onto the target branch without creating a new commit.

9. Recursive merge: A type of merge that occurs when the branches being merged have diverging commit histories and there are conflicting changes. Git uses a recursive strategy to merge the branches and create a new commit that combines the changes from both branches.

Code snippets:

1. Creating a branch and switching to it:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

2. Switching to an existing branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

3. Deleting a branch:
```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

4. Merging branches:
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

5. Resolving a merge conflict:
- Manually edit the conflicting files to resolve conflicts.
- Use `git add <file(s)>` to stage the resolved files.
- Commit the changes using `git commit`.

6. Checking out a branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

These code snippets cover the essential actions and terms related to creating branches, switching branches, deleting branches, merging branches, and resolving merge conflicts in Git.
