Sure! Here are condensed code snippets that focus on the essential actions and concepts:

1. Creating a branch and switching to it:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

2. Switching to an existing branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

3. Deleting a branch (after it has been merged):
```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

4. Merging branches:
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

5. Resolving a merge conflict (manually):
- Edit the conflicting files to resolve conflicts.
- Use `git add <file(s)>` to stage the resolved files.
- Commit the changes using `git commit`.

Note: These snippets assume basic knowledge of Git commands and usage.
