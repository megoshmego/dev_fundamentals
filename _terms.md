4. Git remote add: A command used to add a remote repository to a local Git repository.
5. Origin: The default name given to the remote repository when adding it to the local repository using `git remote add`.
6. Git push: A command used to push local code changes to a remote repository.
7. Branch: A parallel version of a repository that allows for separate development and experimentation without affecting the main codebase.
8. Git branch: A command used to create, list, or switch between branches in a Git repository.
9. Git checkout: A command used to switch between different branches in a Git repository.
10. Git status: A command used to view the current status of the local Git repository, including the branch, modified files, and untracked files.
11. Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the codebase at a specific point in time.

Code snippets:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
```bash
git init
# Create a new repository on GitHub's website
git remote add origin <repository_url>
git push -u origin master
```

2. Add a remote repository to a local Git repository:
```bash
git remote add origin <repository_url>
```

3. Push code to a remote repository:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

4. Push code to a specific branch:
```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

5. Switch between branches:
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

6. View repository status and branch information:
```bash
git status
```

These code snippets demonstrate the process of creating a new repository on GitHub, adding a remote repository to a local Git repository, pushing code to a remote repository, switching between branches, and checking the repository status.

Additional terms:

1. Working tree: The current state of files in the working directory.
2. Remote repository: A Git repository hosted on a remote server.
3. Clone: Create a local copy of a remote repository.
4. Pull: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
5. Merge: Combining changes from different branches.
6. Conflict: A situation when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches due to conflicting changes made to the same file or files.
7. Stash: Temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed.

Code snippets for additional terms:

1. Clone a remote repository:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Pull changes from a remote repository:
```bash
git pull
```

3. Merge changes from another branch:
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

4. Resolve conflicts:
- Manually edit the conflicting files.
- Use `git add <file(s)>` to stage the resolved files.
- Commit the changes using `git commit`.

5. Stash changes:
```bash
git stash
```

These additional code snippets cover terms and actions related to working with remote repositories, cloning, pulling changes, merging branches, resolving conflicts, and stashing changes in Git.
