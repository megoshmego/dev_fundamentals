The important terms and ideas discussed in the transcript are:

1. Git repository: A version control system that allows you to track changes in your files and collaborate with others.

2. Git commands: Various commands used to interact with Git and perform actions within a Git repository.

3. Checkpoints/Save States: Git allows you to create checkpoints or snapshots of changes in your application. You can choose specific changes to include in a commit rather than including all changes in one bulk checkpoint.

4. Working directory: The directory where you make changes to your files.

5. Staging area: The area where you select and prepare changes to be included in the next commit.

6. Commit: A snapshot of changes that you have added to the staging area. Each commit has a unique identifier and a commit message describing the changes.

7. `git init`: Command to initialize a new Git repository in a directory.

8. `git status`: Command to check the status of your repository, including untracked files, modified files, and changes in the staging area.

9. `git add`: Command to add files or changes to the staging area.

10. `git commit`: Command to create a new commit with the changes in the staging area, along with a commit message.

11. `git log`: Command to view the commit history and the commit messages.

12. `git diff`: Command to show the differences between the current state of the files and the previous commit or the changes in the staging area.

Here are some simple demonstrations or code snippets for review:

1. Initialize a new Git repository:
```bash
git init
```

2. Check the status of the repository:
```bash
git status
```

3. Add a file to the staging area:
```bash
git add <file-name>
```

4. Add all changes to the staging area:
```bash
git add .
```

5. Commit changes with a commit message:
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

6. View the commit history:
```bash
git log
```

7. Show the differences between the current state and the previous commit:
```bash
git diff
```

These demonstrations provide a basic understanding of how to initialize a Git repository, track changes, stage files, commit changes, and view the commit history and differences.
