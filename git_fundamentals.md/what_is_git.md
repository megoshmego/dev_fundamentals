Important terms and ideas:
1. Git: A distributed version control system for tracking code changes.
2. Practice: Git requires practice to become proficient and for its benefits to be realized.
3. Clunky commands: Initially, Git commands may seem unintuitive and require practice.
4. Version Control System (VCS): A broader term that encompasses tools like Git, used to track versions of code over time.
5. Snapshots: Git allows developers to create snapshots of code, capturing different states of a project.
6. Collaboration: Git facilitates collaboration among developers, allowing them to share and merge changes.
7. GitHub: A platform for hosting Git repositories and facilitating collaboration.

Code snippets:

1. Initializing a Git repository:
```bash
git init
```

2. Saving a snapshot (committing changes):
```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

3. Checking the history of commits:
```bash
git log
```

4. Undoing changes:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

5. Collaborating with Git:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
git pull
git push
```

These code snippets demonstrate some of the concepts discussed in the transcript, such as initializing a Git repository, committing changes, checking commit history, undoing changes with Git revert, and collaborating with Git through cloning, pulling, and pushing.
